The bot ToD stands for Truth or Dare. ToD is a multi-functional bot with different command categories other than truth or dare. ToD is made to help servers by providing fun truth or dare questions, the questions range from hilarious pre-programmed responses such as "Go outside and argue with a tree", to "Take a shot of mustard or ketchup.". If you would like to add more truth or dare responses of your own, [click this google form link.](https://forms.gle/2TPKzDJHghuoZjyx6) If there are any bugs or errors please feel free to join the support server and report it.

## Additional Information
ToD runs on a private hosting server so the bot should be running 24/7, unless I am doing bug fixes and need to restart the bot, or something else happens that is out of my control. The bot is constantly updating, and with constant updates comes with it's downs, when I reboot ToD, it takes about an average of 5 seconds maybe less to turn the bot off and do a restart, if a command doesn't work wait about 5 seconds and try the command again. More commands will be added soon, such as games and some miscellaneous commands I have in mind. As for right now I am just perfecting the current commands to make sure it doesn't have any bugs and issues. All the commands the fit for PG-13 audiences.

# Private Policy:
ToD (truth or dare) does **not** store data (Guild IDs and User IDs) longer than the time the bot is kept in a server, to be more clear, the bot will **not** store data of that server and it's members after it's been kicked from the server. Any data that gets stored (like for enabling settings like nsfw truths or dares, or antiscam) in a database **will be deleted** when the option is disabled (which will delete the data permanently) or when the bot leaves a server (which will delete all data of that server from all databases and files upon leaving).

The things that ToD **does collect** is **Guild IDs**, **Guild Names**, **User Names and IDs**, **User defined timezones** and **deleted messages** (which will not be stored for a extended period of time, and will be deleted), Any and all information that is collected is deleted once the command is finished executing.
On further note, the developer **cannot see any information from any guild** (like messages and whatnot), as I said, it is deleted once the command is finishing executing and there is no system that can let the developer see any guild information.

Side Note: ToD's anti phishing system does not store any data whatsoever, unless you enable the system manually.
