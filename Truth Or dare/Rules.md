## Truth Or Dare Rules:
> Players must either undertake the dare or answer the question truthfully. The answers must be unrelated to the game. After having the piece of paper read to them, players are not allowed to change their minds about picking "truth" or "dare." "Passing" is an option, but it comes with a penalty. A true pass earns a free dare. If you pass on a dare, you receive a free truth. In a current version of the game, the player is asked, 'Truth, Dare, Kiss, or Swear?' __But the rules can differ depending on who plays it and because this is Discord so you won't be able to do most things.__.
