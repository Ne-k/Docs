The bot ToD is made in Discord.js, and ToD stands for Truth or Dare. ToD is a multi-functional bot with different command categories other than truth or dare. ToD is made to help servers by providing fun truth or dare questions, the questions range from hilarious pre-programmed responses such as "Go outside and argue with a tree", to "Take a shot of mustard or ketchup.". If you would like to add more truth or dare responses of your own, [click this google form link.](https://forms.gle/2TPKzDJHghuoZjyx6) If there are any bugs or errors please feel free to join the support server and report it.
## Additional Information
ToD runs on a private hosting server so the bot should be running 24/7, unless I am doing bug fixes and need to restart the bot, or something else happens that is out of my control. The bot is constantly updating, and with constant updates comes with it's downs, when I reboot ToD, it takes about an average of 5 seconds maybe less to turn the bot off and do a restart, if a command doesn't work wait about 5 seconds and try the command again. More commands will be added soon, such as games and some miscellaneous commands I have in mind. As for right now I am just perfecting the current commands to make sure it doesn't have any bugs and issues. All the commands the fit for PG-13 audiences.

# How to set up the bot:
Setting up the bot and local hosting is pretty simple, be sure to have `NodeJS 14` installed go into the terminal and type `npm i` and it should install everything else. 
After that, go into the `config.json` file and fill out the token, bot prefix, etc and you'll be done. Run `node index.js` or `node .` to start the bot. 



# Private Policy:
ToD does **not** store information, such as guild IDs and user IDs because ToD does not have the ability to do so.
The things that ToD **does collect** is *User defined timezones** and **deleted messages**, but the information is not stored anywhere as an there is **no** database or logging system that will keep the data/deleted messages for a long amount of time. Any and all information that is collected is deleted once the command is finished executing.
On further note, the developer cannot see any information from any guild, as I said, it is deleted once the command is finishing executing and there is no system that can let the developer see any guild information.

**To make it more clear as bot updates go on, any information and/or data that goes to ToD will NOT be stored anywhere would be deleted once the bot has collected the needed data/information and would NOT be shown to the bot developer. The snipe command operates off of the AUDIT logs so therefore no messages and IDs being stored.**
