# What is ToD?
ToD stands for Truth or Dare. ToD is a multi-functional bot with different command categories other than truth or dare. ToD is made to help servers by providing fun truth or dare questions, the questions range from hilarious pre-programmed responses such as "Go outside and argue with a tree", to "Take a shot of mustard or ketchup.". If you would like to add more truth or dare responses of your own, [click this google form link.](https://forms.gle/2TPKzDJHghuoZjyx6) If there are any bugs or errors please feel free to join the support server and report it.
## Additional Information
ToD runs on a private hosting server so the bot should be running 24/7, unless I am doing bug fixes and need to restart the bot, or something else happens that is out of my control. The bot is constantly updating, and with constant updates comes with it's downs, when I reboot ToD, it takes about an average of 5 seconds maybe less to turn the bot off and do a restart, if a command doesn't work wait about 5 seconds and try the command again. More commands will be added soon, such as games and some miscellaneous commands I have in mind. As for right now I am just perfecting the current commands to make sure it doesn't have any bugs and issues. All the commands the fit for PG-13 audiences.
